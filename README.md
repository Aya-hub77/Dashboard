## Admin Dashboard

 - Manage state and props flow between parent and child components.
 - Persist UI state (dark mode, login) using localStorage.
 - Use Recharts for dynamic data visualization.
 - Handle search, filters, and dropdowns efficiently.
 - Build a responsive layout with flexbox and media queries.
 - Implement realistic UI patterns like notifications, tables, and charts.
